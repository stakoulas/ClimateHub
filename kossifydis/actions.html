				    			<p class="card-text">350.org is an international environmental organization addressing the climate crisis. Its stated goal is to end the use of fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy by building a global, grassroots movement.
				        		The 350 in the name stands for 350 ppm (parts per million) of carbon dioxide,which has been identified as the safe upper limit to avoid a climate tipping point.As of 2019, the current level has reached 415 ppm.
				        		Through online campaigns, grassroots organizing, mass public actions, and collaboration with an extensive network of partner groups and organizations, 350.org has mobilized thousands of volunteer organizers in over 188 countries. It is one of the many organizers of the Global Climate Strike from September 20 to 27, 2019 which evolved from the Fridays for Future movement.<span class="dots">...</span>
								<span class="more2"> The fossil fuel divestment campaign, also known as "Fossil Free", borrows activist tactics from other social movements, notably the successful movement against apartheid in South Africa. Since its inception in 2012, over 1110 institutions with more than US$11 trillion in assets under management have committed to divest from fossil fuels. 350.org explains that the reasoning behind this campaign is simple: "If it is wrong to wreck the climate, then it is wrong to profit from that wreckage." 350.org states their demand as the following "We want institutions to immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies, and divest from direct ownership and any commingled funds that include fossil fuel public equities and corporate bonds.”
								The campaign has grown from colleges and universities around the United States to now include other kinds of public and private institutions, such as the City of New York, major Japanese banks, development banks, religious institutions and more. Campaigns for divestment are active and growing around the world.

							<h6 class="card-title">Founded: March 1989</h6>
								<p class="card-text">limate Action Network - International (CAN) is an global network of over 1,300 environmental non-governmental organisations in over 130 countries working to promote government and individual action to limit human-induced climate change to ecologically sustainable levels.[1] It is most active at meetings of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, where it publishes civil society's ECO newsletter presenting the views of civil society and communities around the world during the climate negotiations,[2] and the satirical Fossil of the Day Awards to countries who are blocking the progress at the climate negotiations in implementing the Paris Agreement. It also supports and coordinates its members in its global network through capacity-building, campaigns, projects and mobilisations to urge governments and other stakeholders to act on the climate emergency.
			       				 <span id="dots">...<span id="more3">CAN members work to achieve this goal through the coordination of information exchange and non-governmental organizational strategy on international, regional and national climate issues. CAN members place a high priority on both a healthy environment and development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland Commission). Climate Action Network's vision is to protect the atmosphere while allowing for sustainable and equitable development worldwide.</span>

						<h2 class="card-title">IPCC:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</h>
							<h6 class="card-title">Founder: Bert Bolin 1988</h6>
								<p class="card-text">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an intergovernmental body of the United Nations that is dedicated to providing the world with objective, scientific information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of the risk of human-induced climate change, its natural, political, and economic impacts and risks, and possible response options.
			        			The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and was later endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly. Membership is open to all members of the WMO and UN. The IPCC produces reports that contribute to the work of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main international treaty on climate change. The objective of the UNFCCC is to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system". The IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report was a critical scientific input into the UNFCCC's Paris Agreement in 2015.
			       				 <span id="dots">...<span id="more">
			       				 IPCC reports cover the "scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation." The IPCC does not carry out original research, nor does it monitor climate or related phenomena itself. Rather, it assesses published literature, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources. However, the IPCC can be said to stimulate research in climate science. Chapters of IPCC reports often close with sections on limitations and knowledge or research gaps, and the announcement of an IPCC special report can catalyse research activity in that area.
